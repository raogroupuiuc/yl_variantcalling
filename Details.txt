File name explanations: 
1) strains: PO1f, 16EV, 1EV, 2EV, 41EV (total 5) 
   - the genome for these samples was downloaded from NCBI (  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/009/372/015/GCA_009372015.1_YarliW29/* )
2) plasmid: X123, XEV, GEV (total 3) 
   - the genome for these samples was the plasmid files added to the NCBI files
